# Getting Started with VPE Leaderboard

Welcome to the **VPE Leaderboard**! This framework provides an interactive environment for biomodel simulation and AI-powered time series prediction.

## Installation

You can install and use VPE Leaderboard in two ways:

### 1. Using PyPI (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is by installing the package via **PyPI**.

#### Steps:
1. **Ensure Python is Installed**  
   Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. You can check by running:
   ```
   python --version
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
    ```
    python -m venv vpe_env
    source vpe_env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    vpe_env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    ```

3. **Install the Package** 
    ```    
    pip install vpe-leaderboard
    ```

### 2. Using GitHub (For Developers)

If you want the latest development version or wish to contribute, install directly from GitHub.

#### Steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/vpe-leaderboard.git
    cd vpe-leaderboard
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
    ```
    python -m venv vpe_env
    source vpe_env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    vpe_env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Next Steps

Explore **cutting-edge algorithms**, leverage **QSP models** for biomodel simulations, and benchmark performance with the **leaderboard** to refine your approach and stay ahead!
